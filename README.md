# GRADUATION-PROJECT--KNOWLEDGE-DISCOVERY-IN-DATABASES-KDD-MODEL-FOR-CLASSIFICATION-OF-MEDICAL-DATASET

•The objective of this project is to prepare a comparative analysis on which data mining techniques have better accuracy in predicting Cardiovascular Diseases.

•The comparative analysis can be used by other researchers or by other software developers who are willing to work on developing software on heart diseases. 

•This project gives an insight into the accuracy of the Genetic Algorithm(GA), Fuzzy logic, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Rough set on the sparse data of Cardiovascular Disease.
